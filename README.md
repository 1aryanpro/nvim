# Neovim Configuration
This is my neovim configuration that I've been working on for quite a while. It is heavily opinionated so it may not work for everybody, but it's packed with all the features for editing most types of files. I'm always working on and updating it, but there are circumstances where I remove functionality because I stop using it.

To get the full features of this config you need:
* neovim
* jdtls (if you want java lsp)
